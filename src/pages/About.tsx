              My career began in the dynamic world of marketing, where I honed
              skills in understanding user needs, crafting compelling
              narratives, and strategizing for impact. While successful, I found
              myself increasingly drawn to the technical side â€“ the 'how' behind
              digital experiences.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              This curiosity sparked a transition. I immersed myself in learning
              development, discovering a passion for problem-solving through
              code. The analytical thinking from marketing proved invaluable,
              now applied to building robust and elegant software solutions.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Today, I blend my marketing acumen with technical expertise to
              create user-centric applications. I understand the importance of
              both form and function, ensuring that every project not only works
              flawlessly but also resonates with its intended audience.
